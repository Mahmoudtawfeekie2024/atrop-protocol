# ATROP – Autonomous Topology-Optimized Routing Protocol

> ⚙️ AI-Native | 🧠 ML-Augmented | 🛰 Topology-Aware | 🔐 Zero-Trust Secure | 🧩 Protocol-Independent

ATROP is a **conceptual next-generation routing protocol** designed to transform the way networks learn, optimize, and secure themselves in real time. It introduces a **dual-plane architecture** — combining **AI in the control plane** and **ML in the data plane** — to create **self-optimizing**, **intent-driven**, and **topology-sensitive** routing behavior across intra- and inter-domain networks.

This repository serves as the **reference structure**, **SDK seed**, and **community collaboration point** for ATROP protocol development, simulation, and eventual standardization.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Driven Control Plane**  
  Uses Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Reinforcement Learning to dynamically compute routes based on topology, traffic, and service intent.

- ⚡ **ML-Augmented Data Plane**  
  Inline ML models classify, reroute, and optimize flows in real time using feedback mechanisms.

- 🗺 **Autonomous Topology Zones (ATZ)**  
  Supports hierarchical, zone-based learning and decision logic for scalable deployments.

- 🔐 **Built-in Security & Trust Model**  
  Enforces zero-trust adjacency, cryptographic identity vectors (NIV), and per-hop validation.

- 🔄 **Full Interoperability**  
  Compatible with OSPF, BGP, IS-IS, MPLS, Segment Routing, VXLAN, SRv6, and more — via dynamic interoperability modules.

- 🧪 **Vendor-Ready Architecture**  
  Designed for native integration into Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Huawei, and open-source stacks (e.g., FRR, SONiC).
