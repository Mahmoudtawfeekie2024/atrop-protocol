# 🌐 Contributing to ATROP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **ATROP** — the Autonomous Topology-Optimized Routing Protocol.

ATROP is a conceptual AI/ML-native routing architecture designed for vendor-neutral, scalable, and secure deployment across all network domains. This repository hosts research, design artifacts, specifications, and early test frameworks — not production code.

We welcome engineers, researchers, architects, vendors, and students to contribute ideas, improvements, and collaboration.

## ✅ What You Can Contribute

This is a **design-stage protocol**, so contributions are **not limited to code**. You can help by:

- 💡 Suggesting enhancements to protocol state machines, headers, or behavior logic
- 📐 Designing or editing diagrams (FSMs, feedback loops, learning pipelines)
- 🧠 Proposing AI/ML model optimizations for control or data plane behavior
- ✍️ Improving documentation (README, whitepapers, spec formatting)
- 📦 Providing test cases, Mininet topologies, or FRRouting integration
- 🗣 Sharing use cases, deployment models, or vendor integration concerns
- 🔒 Suggesting improvements to the trust/security model

## 🧭 Guidelines

### 1. 📂 Fork This Repository
Create your own copy to propose changes:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atrop-protocol.git

Use a descriptive branch name:

```
git checkout -b fix-fsm-transition
```

### 3. 📥 Make Your Changes

* Keep file structure clean and consistent.
* Use Markdown or PlantUML for diagrams.
* If modifying AI/ML logic, describe model type, input/output, and use case.
* Include comments for all technical additions.

### 4. ✅ Test and Document

If you add code (e.g., daemon or model logic):

* Add unit or integration tests in `/test`
* Update README or specs with your change

### 5. 📬 Submit a Pull Request

Push to your fork and open a PR:

```
git push origin fix-fsm-transition
```

When submitting:

* Use a clear title and summary
* Link to related issue(s) if applicable
* Mark whether it’s **experimental**, **conceptual**, or **ready for review**
