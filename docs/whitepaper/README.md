## üß≠ Purpose

The whitepaper provides the **technical, architectural, and strategic framing** of ATROP as a next-generation, AI-native routing protocol. It is intended to support:

- Vendor onboarding (Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Huawei, etc.)
- Standards discussions with IETF, IEEE, and research bodies
- Protocol implementation planning
- Governance and licensing model alignment
- Academic and open-source collaboration
