# 📏 ATROP Standards & Compliance Overview

This section documents how **ATROP** aligns with established networking and security standards from bodies like **IETF**, **IEEE**, and major vendor platforms. This ensures interoperability, regulatory readiness, and a strong foundation for protocol standardization proposals.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Ensure **backward and forward compatibility** with existing routing and transport standards
- Align with **security models and cryptographic standards**
- Support interoperability with **Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Huawei**, and whitebox ecosystems
- Enable contribution to **IETF** and **IEEE** working groups for future ATROP standardization

## 📚 Compliance Areas

### ✅ IETF Alignment

| IETF Standard / RFC | Relevance to ATROP |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| RFC 3552 | Threat model definition and secure protocol design guidelines |
| RFC 4948 | Security issues in routing architecture |
| RFC 6811 | Prefix origin filtering (applied in trust domain enforcement) |
| RFC 8200 | IPv6 header and extension compatibility |
| RFC 8481 | BGP origin validation (used in interop mode) |
| RFC 9092 | Secure routing operations in inter-domain fabric |
| BCP 72 / RFC 2119 | Keywords for requirement levels (used throughout ATROP spec) |

📁 See: [`specs/security/`](../../specs/security/)

---

### ✅ IEEE 802.x Compliance

| IEEE Spec | Role in ATROP |
|-----------|----------------|
| IEEE 802.1X | Port-based identity verification (mapped to NIV handshake) |
| IEEE 802.1AE (MACsec) | Link-layer encryption during Discovery/Correction messages |
| IEEE 802.1Q | VLAN/QoS awareness for policy enforcement and intent tagging |
| IEEE 802.1AR | Secure Device Identity (used as part of NIV profile) |
| IEEE 802.3 | Physical interface compliance for telemetry export and MAC interaction |

## 🤝 Vendor Platform Compliance

| Vendor | Supported Features |
|--------|---------------------|
| Cisco IOS-XR / NX-OS | Native OS agent, Netlink + UADP SDK, secure module integration |
| Juniper JunOS / Paragon | Routing engine hooks, telemetry via JTI, Paragon policy sync |
| Arista EOS | SysDB integration, Broadcom SDK compatibility, CloudVision |
| Huawei VRP | VRP plugin via x86 or Ascend AI module, iMaster NCE integration |
| Whitebox / Open NOS | SONiC, DENT, FRRouting, OpenWRT — passive mode & SDK compatible |

📁 See: [`examples/vendor-hooks/`](../../examples/vendor-hooks/)

## 🔐 Security Standards & Crypto Models

| Standard | Used In |
|----------|----------|
| TLS 1.3 | Optional control channel encryption |
| Ed25519 / SHA-2 / HMAC | Signing Node Identity Vector (NIV) |
| Post-Quantum Ready | Supports future use of Dilithium, Kyber (via plugin) |
| X.509 | NIV trust anchor format (optional) |
| MACsec | Intra-zone L2 control packet encryption (optional) |

📁 See: [`specs/security/`](../../specs/security/)

## 📎 Planned Submissions & Engagement

| Standards Body | Plan |
|----------------|------|
| IETF RTGWG / IDR | Draft-00 submission planned Q1 2026 (experimental track) |
| IEEE 802.1 / 802.3 | Positioning for TSN + SDN alignment discussions |
| OpenLab/IETF Sandbox | Simulated protocol exposure for standards feedback |

## ⚠️ Notes

- ATROP is a conceptual protocol in pre-standardization phase.
- Compliance profiles are designed for vendor evaluation and community prototyping.
- Compatibility goals are intended to reduce migration barriers in brownfield deployments.
