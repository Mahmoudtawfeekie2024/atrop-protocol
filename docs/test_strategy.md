# üß™ ATROP Test Strategy

**Document Version:** 0.1  
**Maintainer:** Test Architect  
**Last Updated:** 25 June 2025  
**Applies To:** Foundational protocol components during initial implementation

---

## üéØ Purpose

This strategy defines the multi-layered test approach for the initial implementation of the ATROP protocol. Its goal is to ensure all protocol components ‚Äî including control and data planes, IPC, FSMs, and telemetry ‚Äî are tested early, modularly, and continuously. This supports test-driven development, fault isolation, and long-term maintainability across diverse deployment environments.

---

## üß± Scope

This test strategy applies to the core components of ATROP, focusing on validating behavior, interoperability, and resilience under both expected and anomalous conditions.

The testing framework will cover:

- **Finite State Machines (FSMs):** Represent the node-level behavioral logic of ATROP, managing key states such as INIT, DISCOVERY, LEARN, ENFORCE, FEEDBACK, and CORRECT. These are essential for autonomous topology awareness and self-healing.

- **AI-Based Control Plane:** Performs policy-driven decision-making using topology intelligence, graph analysis, and reinforcement learning. Tests will evaluate AI route decisions, fallback logic, and intent enforcement.

- **ML-Augmented Data Plane:** Executes real-time per-packet inference to classify flows, apply trust scoring, and emit Feedback Injection Fields (FIF). Coverage includes inference correctness, telemetry generation, and integration with AI feedback loops.

- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Enables secure and efficient communication between the control plane, data plane, and auxiliary modules. Testing covers message structure, queue behavior, error handling, and protocol synchronization.

- **Telemetry and Feedback Loop:** Validates the generation, propagation, and consumption of telemetry fields (PIV, FIF, IDR), ensuring data plane behavior accurately informs AI model updates and zone decisions.

- **Legacy Compatibility and Integration:** Ensures ATROP can coexist with or interoperate across traditional protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP, MPLS). Tests validate correct redistribution, policy translation, and hook behavior for brownfield deployment.

This strategy supports incremental validation of ATROP‚Äôs unique autonomous behavior while providing a stable foundation for integration with legacy networks and emerging infrastructure.
